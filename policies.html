<h1>Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</h1>
<h2>1. Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Here at MusicTools and Sub 6 Resources, we care greatly about your privacy. This privacy policy covers the information that we collect, and who has access to this data.</p>
<h3>A. Personally Identifiable Data</h3>
<p>At MusicTools, the information we collect about you is simple. When you create an account, we collect your email address and the name that you submitted as your account name. If signing in with Google, your profile picture URL is also stored in order to display it on the website when you sign in. If signing in by email, then no profile picture is collected unless you choose to upload one to the site at a later date. </p>
<p>Who has access to my personally identifiably data? </p>
Only you and the site administrator. Your information is not shared with anybody else. Why the site administrator? Because as listed in our <a href="#terms">Terms of Service </a>, MusicTools reserves the right to delete any account that it deems contains innappropriate content. In order to check for innappropriate content, the MusicTools administrator frequently checks accounts.</p>
<p>Your information is not given or sold to any third-parties. </p>
<h3>B. Information Security</h3>
<p>All efforts will be taken in order to protect your data, including, when possible, encrypting the data. If any attempts are made at stealing your data, we will notify you and bring our site offline to protect further breaches, as well as contacting the proper authorities. </p>
<h3>C. Child Protection </h3>
<p>We take every precaution to prevent children under the age of 13's data from being stored in our databases. To our knowledge, no children under the age of thirteen have data stored on our site. If you believe that your child's data is being stored in our database, contact us at <a href="mailto:sub6resources@gmail.com">sub6resources@gmail.com</a> and we will delete it as soon as possible. </p>
